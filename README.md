# ArrayJumps
My answer to an interviewing question I had for Whitepages; going to look into creating and uploading some test files. O(n) solution but I didn't pass the interview which leads me to believe I missed something somewhere.


## Problem
The bare bones of the problem can be found here:

In the case of the problem presented to me, landing on a 0 meant failure, and stdout had to include the path we had to take (that is, every index that we used as a jump.)
